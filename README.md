# Media Playback Quality

This repository contains the [Media Playback Quality](https://w3c.github.io/media-playback-quality/) specification, developed by the [Media Working Group](https://www.w3.org/media-wg/).

The specification extends `HTMLVideoElement` to add new features that can be used to detect the user perceived playback quality, and was originally defined in the [Media Source Extensions specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-media-source-20161117/#VideoPlaybackQuality).
